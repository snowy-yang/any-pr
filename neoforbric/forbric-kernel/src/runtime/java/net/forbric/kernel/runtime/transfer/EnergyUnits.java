/**
 * Energy arithmetic shared by every bridge direction. One Forge Energy unit (FE, NeoForge) is one
 * Team Reborn Energy unit (E): the two APIs describe the same quantity and no exchange rate is applied anywhere.
 *
 * <p>The only unit difference is width. NeoForge moves {@code int} amounts, Reborn moves {@code long}. A long
 * request is clamped to what the int side can express BEFORE anything moves; the int side then reports what it
 * really moved, and that exact amount is what the long side sees. The unrepresentable remainder is never moved, so
 * it stays in its source: nothing is rounded after a mutation, and no energy is created or destroyed. A long AMOUNT
 * read through an int API saturates at {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}; that is a read, never a transfer.
 *
 * <p>Pure: no game or API type, so the unit tests exercise it directly.
